					<p>
						The rules for pronouncing words in Tolkien’s languages
						are laid out in The Lord of the Rings, Appendix E.
						Stress, in particular, works like this (for both Quenya and Sindarin):
					</p>
					<p>
						By default, words are stressed on the third-to-last syllable.
						(This doesn’t mean that the third-to-last syllable is <em>usually</em> the stressed one –
						the below exceptions are not uncommon –
						merely that this is where the stress goes if no exception applies.)
						For example:
						<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">A</span><span class="syllable">ra</span><span class="syllable">gorn</span></span>,
						<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">Bo</span><span class="syllable">ro</span><span class="syllable">mir</span></span>,
						<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">De</span><span class="syllable">ne</span><span class="syllable">thor</span></span>,
						<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Ga</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">lad</span><span class="syllable">ri</span><span class="syllable">el</span></span>,
						<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Loth</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">ló</span><span class="syllable">ri</span><span class="syllable">en</span></span>,
						<span class="word" lang="qya"><span class="syllable">Un</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">dó</span><span class="syllable">mi</span><span class="syllable">el</span></span>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The stress falls on the second-to-last syllable if that contains:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								A long vowel,
								marked with an acute accent
								(<span class="fragment">á</span>, <span class="fragment">é</span>, <span class="fragment">í</span>, <span class="fragment">ó</span>, <span class="fragment">ú</span>).
								For example:
								<span class="word" lang="qya"><span class="syllable">E</span><span class="syllable">len</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">tá</span><span class="syllable">ri</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="qya"><span class="syllable">Cui</span><span class="syllable">vi</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">é</span><span class="syllable">nen</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Ce</span><span class="syllable">leb</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">rí</span><span class="syllable">an</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="qya"><span class="syllable">Pe</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">ló</span><span class="syllable">ri</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="qya"><span class="syllable">An</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">dú</span><span class="syllable">ril</span></span>.
							</p>
							<p>
								Note that the acute accent does not mark a stressed syllable <i>per se</i>,
								and there are words where it occurs in an unstressed syllable:
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">Naug</span><span class="syllable">la</span><span class="syllable">mír</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">pa</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">lan</span><span class="syllable">tír</span></span>
								(plural <span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">pa</span><span class="syllable">lan</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">tí</span><span class="syllable">ri</span></span>).
								That said, if a word features an accute accent, it is very <em>likely</em> to be on the stressed syllable.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								A diphthong.
								For example:
								<span class="word" lang="qya"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">Sau</span><span class="syllable">ron</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">Gwai</span><span class="syllable">hir</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Cris</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">saeg</span><span class="syllable">rim</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Fin</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">dui</span><span class="syllable">las</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Mi</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">thei</span><span class="syllable">thel</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Ne</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">nui</span><span class="syllable">al</span></span>.
							</p>
							<p>
								The vowel pairs that form diphthongs vary by language:
								in Quenya, the diphthongs are
								<span class="fragment">ui</span>/<span class="fragment">oi</span>/<span class="fragment">ai</span>
								and <span class="fragment">iu</span>/<span class="fragment">eu</span>/<span class="fragment">au</span>,
								whereas in Sindarin they are
								<span class="fragment">ae</span>, <span class="fragment">ai</span>, <span class="fragment">ei</span>, <span class="fragment">oe</span>, <span class="fragment">ui</span>, and <span class="fragment">au</span>.
								Put differently,
								<span class="fragment">ui</span>, <span class="fragment">ai</span> and <span class="fragment">au</span> are always diphthongs,
								<span class="fragment">oi</span>, <span class="fragment">iu</span> and <span class="fragment">eu</span> are only diphthongs in Quenya,
								and <span class="fragment">ae</span>, <span class="fragment">ei</span> and <span class="fragment">oe</span> are only diphthongs in Sindarin.
								That said, the latter six pairs seem to be rare in the language where they’re not a diphthong.
							</p>
							<p class="show-syllable-breaks">
								Vowel pairs which aren’t diphthongs are sometimes distinguished with a trema,
								as in
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">Fë</span><span class="syllable">a</span><span class="syllable">nor</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="qya"><span class="syllable">Na</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">má</span><span class="syllable">ri</span><span class="syllable">ë</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="qya"><span class="syllable">E</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">ön</span><span class="syllable">wë</span></span>;
								but this is not always done,
								as in
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">Mo</span><span class="syllable">ri</span><span class="syllable">a</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">I</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">thi</span><span class="syllable">li</span><span class="syllable">en</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">E</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">ri</span><span class="syllable">a</span><span class="syllable">dor</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Os</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">gi</span><span class="syllable">li</span><span class="syllable">ath</span></span>,
								all of which feature nondiphthongal vowel pairs and are not usually written with a trema.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								A vowel followed by two or more consonants.
								For example:
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Mith</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">ran</span><span class="syllable">dir</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="qya"><span class="syllable">E</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">len</span><span class="syllable">dil</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="qya"><span class="syllable">I</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">sil</span><span class="syllable">dur</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Tho</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">ron</span><span class="syllable">dor</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="qya"><span class="syllable">U</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">tum</span><span class="syllable">no</span></span>.
							</p>
							<p>
								This includes double consonants, which represent a longer version of the same consonant, for example:
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Mo</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">ran</span><span class="syllable">non</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Pe</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">len</span><span class="syllable">nor</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="qya"><span class="syllable">E</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">les</span><span class="syllable">sar</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Bra</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">gol</span><span class="syllable">lach</span></span>.
							</p>
							<p>
								Note that <span class="fragment">ch</span>, <span class="fragment">dh</span>, <span class="fragment">th</span> count as <em>single</em> consonants here;
								therefore
								<!--
									I have not found any suitable example with a second syllable followed by ch plus a consonant.
									Presumably, one could be constructed by prefixing a third syllable to Sindarin rochben, rider;
									however, I have no idea if any such composition is present in Tolkien’s writing.
								  -->
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Ca</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">radh</span><span class="syllable">ras</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Fa</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">lath</span><span class="syllable">rim</span></span>,
								but
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">Fo</span><span class="syllable">ro</span><span class="syllable">chel</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">Ga</span><span class="syllable">la</span><span class="syllable">dhon</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">De</span><span class="syllable">ne</span><span class="syllable">thor</span></span>.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						If there are less than three syllables, the first syllable is stressed,
						as in
						<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">A</span><span class="syllable">mon</span></span>
						<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">A</span><span class="syllable">marth</span></span>,
						<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">Grond</span></span>.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the division of words into syllables themselves,
						two aspects are worth noting:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class="fragment">y</span> is a consonant in Quenya, but a vowel in Sindarin.
								Thus, in Quenya
								<span class="word" lang="qya"><span class="syllable">Ca</span><span class="syllable">la</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">cir</span><span class="syllable">ya</span></span>,
								stress falls on the <span class="fragment">cir</span> syllable because its vowel is followed by two consonants (<span class="fragment">r</span> and <span class="fragment">y</span>),
								whereas in Sindarin the <span class="fragment">y</span> would be a vowel and therefore its own syllable
								(though the stress would still fall on the <span class="fragment">cir</span> syllable, since it would then be the third-to-last syllable).
								On the other hand, a name like
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">E</span><span class="syllable">myn</span></span>
								<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">Muil</span></span>
								can only be Sindarin, since in Quenya the <span class="fragment">myn</span> would be an unpronounceable jumble of three consonants.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Also, in Quenya the sequence <span class="fragment">qu</span> represents two consonants (<span class="fragment">cw</span>),
								and the <span class="fragment">u</span> therefore does not constitute a syllable of its own.
								However, a <span class="fragment">qu-</span> syllable is often followed by another,
								and so it is rare that these two consonants actually make a syllable stressed that wouldn’t be stressed anyways (as the third-to-last syllable);
								two examples are
								<span class="word" lang="qya"><span class="syllable">a</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">ta</span><span class="syllable">quë</span></span>,
								<span class="word" lang="qya"><span class="syllable">o</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">to</span><span class="syllable">quë</span></span>.
								(In Sindarin, <span class="fragment">qu</span> does not occur.)
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Finally, keep in mind that not all names in Tolkien’s works follow these rules.
						For instance, the Elvish rules would mandate that Isengard is stressed
						<span class="word wrong"><span class="syllable">I</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">sen</span><span class="syllable">gard</span></span>,
						since the <span class="fragment">e</span> is followed by two consonants;
						however, the word is actually of English form,
						translated from the language of the Rohirrim,
						and therefore stressed as would be more natural in English:
						<span class="word"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">I</span><span class="syllable">sen</span><span class="syllable">gard</span></span>.
						(Elvish pronunciation would also dictate that the <span class="fragment">i</span> is that of “machine”, rather than that of “iron”.)
					</p>
					<h3>And what about hyphenated words?</h3>
					<p>
						Appendix E doesn’t directly say how the stress rules apply to hyphenated words,
						which are uncommon but not completely unheard of.
						Maybe each part should be analysed separately,
						or maybe the whole word should be analysed as if the hyphens weren’t there at all.
					</p>
					<p>
						The strongest hint in the text is probably the poem “<i>Gil-galad was an Elven-king</i>”,
						which begins like this:
					</p>
					<blockquote class="blockquote">
						Gil-galad was an Elven-king.<br>
						Of him the harpers sadly sing:
						<footer class="blockquote-footer"><cite>The Fellowship of the Ring</cite> I 11</footer>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						The metre here strongly suggests a stress on the first syllable of <span class="fragment">galad</span>,
						which is consistent with the interpretation that each part should be analysed separately:
						then, that syllable would be stressed as the first syllable of its part.
						(Otherwise, the stress would fall on <span class="fragment">Gil</span>.)
					</p>
					<p>
						Personally, I did not find this wholly convincing –
						I had gotten accustomed to stressing <span class="fragment">Gil-galad</span> on the first syllable,
						and was reluctant to give that up.
						What won me over was the realization of what each interpretation meant for another word, <span class="fragment">Barad-dûr</span>:
						if the whole word should be analysed without regard to the hyphens,
						then the stress there must fall on the second syllable,
						since it would then be followed by a double consonant:
						<span class="text wrong" lang="sjn"><span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Ba</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">rad</span></span>-<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">dûr</span></span></span>.
						That sounds utterly absurd to me,
						and so I accepted that each part should be analysed separately,
						yielding
						<span class="text" lang="sjn"><span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">Gil</span></span>-<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">ga</span><span class="syllable">lad</span></span></span>
						(with the first stress being secondary or weaker)
						and
						<span class="text" lang="sjn"><span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">Ba</span><span class="syllable">rad</span></span>-<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">dûr</span></span></span>.
						Consequently, that is the rule which this tool applies.
					</p>
					<h3>And what about <span lang="sjn">Imladris</span> and <span lang="sjn">Nargothrond</span>?</h3>
					<p>
						In both <span lang="sjn">Imladris</span> and <span lang="sjn">Nargothrond</span>, the second-to-last vowel is followed by two consonants,
						and so Appendix E dictates that they should be stressed on the second-to-last syllable:
						<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Im</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">lad</span><span class="syllable">ris</span></span>,
						<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Nar</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">goth</span><span class="syllable">rond</span></span>.
						However, several poems suggest the stress should actually be on the first syllable:
					</p>
					<blockquote class="blockquote">
						Seek for the Sword that was broken:<br>
						<span class="ml-4"></span>In <span lang="sjn">Imladris</span> it dwells;
						<footer class="blockquote-footer"><cite>The Fellowship of the Ring</cite> II 2</footer>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote class="blockquote">
						The world was fair, the mountains tall,<br>
						In Elder Days before the fall<br>
						Of mighty kings in <span lang="sjn">Nargothrond</span><br>
						And <span lang="sjn">Gondolin</span>, who now beyond<br>
						The Western Seas have passed away:<br>
						The world was fair in Durin’s Day.<br>
						<footer class="blockquote-footer"><cite>The Fellowship of the Ring</cite> II 4</footer>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						Others have noticed this before, and some have suggested a solution for this conundrum:
						Sindarin might feature a rule similar to one found in Latin,
						sometimes called <i>muta cum liquida</i>,
						where certain combinations of two consonants really count as one,
						both for syllabification and for stress:
						<span class="word show-syllable-breaks" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">Im</span><span class="syllable">la</span><span class="syllable">dris</span></span> and
						<span class="word show-syllable-breaks" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">Nar</span><span class="syllable">go</span><span class="syllable">thrond</span></span>,
						rather than
						<span class="word show-syllable-breaks" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Im</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">lad</span><span class="syllable">ris</span></span> and
						<span class="word show-syllable-breaks" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Nar</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">goth</span><span class="syllable">rond</span></span>.
						<a href="https://menegroth.github.io/stress-in-sindarin.html">Concerning Stress Placement In Sindarin</a>
						is an accessible explanation of this rule and also links to other discussions about it.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the purposes of this tool,
						the important thing to note is that the rule, even if we accept its existence,
						does not seem to be applied systematically.
						For example, consider Gandalf’s words before the West-gate of <span lang="sjn">Moria</span>:
					</p>
					<blockquote class="blockquote" lang="sjn">
						Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!<br>
						Fennas nogothrim, lasto beth lammen!
						<footer class="blockquote-footer" lang="en"><cite>The Fellowship of the Ring</cite> II 4</footer>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						Here,
						<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">no</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">goth</span><span class="syllable">rim</span></span>
						is clearly meant to be stressed on the second syllable, as Appendix E dictates,
						even though it contains the same <span class="fragment">othr</span> sequence which in Nargothrond we are led to believe does not make the <span class="fragment">o</span> stressed.
						For that reason, this tool does not attempt to guess when the <i>muta cum liquida</i> rule might apply or not,
						and if you ask it to analyse Imladris and Nargothrond,
						it will tell you that, in accordance with Appendix E,
						they should be stressed
						<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Im</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">lad</span><span class="syllable">ris</span></span>,
						<span class="word" lang="sjn"><span class="syllable">Nar</span><span class="syllable syllable-stressed">goth</span><span class="syllable">rond</span></span>.
						Whether you believe that, or allow for the <i>muta cum liquida</i> rule,
						is ultimately up to you.
