# Tolkien Stress Analyser

A website to determine the stressed syllable of a word in one of Tolkien’s languages.
Work in progress.

## Resources

- The Lord of the Rings, Appendix E
- To determine whether a word is Quenya or Sindarin (for the tests and the explanation section):
  - [Quenya dictionary](https://www.ambar-eldaron.com/telechargements/quenya-engl-A4.pdf)
  - [Sindarin dictionary](https://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/sindar/dict-sd-en.html)
  - [Tolkien Gateway](http://tolkiengateway.net/), where most articles helpfully have an “Etymology” section
