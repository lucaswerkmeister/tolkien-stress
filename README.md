# Tolkien Stress Analyser

A website to determine the stressed syllable of a word in one of Tolkien’s languages.

## Resources

- The Lord of the Rings, Appendix E
- To determine whether a word is Quenya or Sindarin (for the tests and the explanation section):
  - [Quenya dictionary](https://www.ambar-eldaron.com/telechargements/quenya-engl-A4.pdf)
  - [Sindarin dictionary](https://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/sindar/dict-sd-en.html)
  - [Tolkien Gateway](http://tolkiengateway.net/), where most articles helpfully have an “Etymology” section

## Missing features

I would like to support the analysis of not just individual words,
but phrases like “Amon Amarth” or “Emyn Muil”,
showing the correct stress in each word.
Tied in with this is the correct analysis of hyphenated words like “Gil-galad” and “Barad-dûr”,
because I believe each component there needs to be analysed separately as well.
